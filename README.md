# photocell
A simulation to show the essence of the photoelectric effect.

This project was developed for a school presentation about the nature of electromagnetic waves and electrons.

To start the simulation, run main.py. The light-intensity, wavelength, voltage between the electrodes and the catode material can be changed to observe the effects of those variables in photoelectricity.
